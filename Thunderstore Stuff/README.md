Basic Description
------------
Two new equipment: Untapped Potential and Tempestuous Rage.
UP is a basic equipment that will give the user an elite buff for the rest of the stage then destroy itself.
TR is a lunar equipment that will give the user the elite buff of the most recent elite that hurt them. This buff will be kept between stages, but also comes with a curse that increases ALL damage taken.
The curses from TR can be temporarily reduced by gaining the elite buff via UP, Wake of Vultures, or the normal Elite Equipment. (The percent damage increase per curse is configurable)

Planned Features
------------
Some UI element to track curses and elite effects (beside the buff icons)
When buffs are given by UP or TR, give the elite equip display
