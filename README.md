# Affix Generator
This mod includes two new equipment that increase the chance of gaining an elite affect.
The basic version, Pale Orb, increases the chance by 1% per use.
The lunar version, Soul of a Tempest, increases the chance by 10% per use, but also increases damage taken from elites by 10%.
The lunar debuff can be reduced by killing elites as an elite.
(This is probably overtuned right now, so comments are appreciated.)
